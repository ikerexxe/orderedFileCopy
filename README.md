# orderedFileCopy
## Description
orderedFileCopy is a software that enables to copy files from one location to another orderly. This is done due to some limitations found in different browsers and peripherals, for example mp3 players, where the copy of the files is done in a disorderly fashion. This causes the files to be shown (or reproduced) in the wrong order. Thus, the user has to create the folders one by one and copy the files manually, which is not a neat solution. An example of this type of problems is Sunstech's DEDALO III mp3 player.

orderedFileCopy is developed in Python.
## Execution
